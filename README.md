# Discord user verification bot

The bot sends a simple 4 digit code to new server members via DM and after the user verifies the code, it is given a specific role according to your needs.


This helps in avoiding raids and spam accounts and keeps your server safe.

All the users and the verification code sent to them is kept in MongoDB for reference if needed.
